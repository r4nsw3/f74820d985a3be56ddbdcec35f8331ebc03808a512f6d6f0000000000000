  |   For bikers, there are two types of speed races: the Isle of Man TT    |
  |   and the rest. No other race is as gruelling for the motorbikes and    |
  |   demanding for the riders. Take up the challenge of the Snaefell       |
  |   Mountain course: all 37.73 miles faithfully reproduced with the       |
  |   champions and their bikes. Memorise each section of the course,       |
  |   round each bend to perfection, keep your concentration throughout     |
  |   the 6 laps, get the best time and write your name alongside the       |
  |   greatest champions.                                                   |

  |   - Ride the Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade with the 'Tribute to Joey        |
  |   Dunlop' livery as John McGuinness, 23-time TT winner, with special    |
  |   leather and helmet.                                                   |

  |   This motorbike marked the 30-year anniversary of legendary rider      |
  |   Joey Dunlop's first TT victory with the Honda team.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Rediscover the Isle of Man race in solo or co-op mode, with the     |
  |   addition of 3 sidecars. An experience that completely changes the     |
  |   gameplay through different physics and handling, with new and         |
  |   intense sensations of speed but still just as demanding!              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In solo mode, you control the rider with one stick and the            |
  |   passenger with another, or let the AI control the passenger. Ask a    |
  |   friend to join you in co-op mode and have both of you complete the    |
  |   race. Decide who will be the rider and who will be the passenger!     |
  |   Coordination is the key to success.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The DLC also includes French rider Xavier Denis of the Optimark       |
  |   team, with his motorbikes: the Kawasaki ZX10R in Superbike and the    |
  |   Honda CBR600RR in the Supersport category.                            |
